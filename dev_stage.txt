stage 1: basic crud on budgets, transactions
stage 2: updating on balance, basic UI
- Dashboard:
+ shows the total balance, income, expenses
-- redo the dashboard with three sections:
--- stats (now gives us the total balance)
--- recent transactions
--- budgets (done)
+ each budget shows their balance
+ shows latest transactions
+ cannot have adding transaction in the dashboard
+ has good UI
- BudgetPage:
+ shows the total balance, income, expenses
+ can only add transaction directly to the budget
+ update name, delete budget feature
+ each budget shows their balance
+ shows latest transactions
+ has good UI
stage 3: transaction modifications:
type: withdraw/add 
- warning when the budget goes under 0
date: now() (default) or exact time to minute
repeated transactions: (set up modes)
stage 4: set up income (tricky)
stage 5: set up shares (tricky)
